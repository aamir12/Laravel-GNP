 * Client APIs for magaging KPI data.
 *
 * KPI provide a record of a user's performance over time. Each KPI record is a
 * simple timestamped value. KPI are highly configurable, allowing the system to
 * work with whatever metric the client requires. For example, a KPI record
 * could hold a percentage, a true/false value, or just a simple numeric value.
 *
 * A userâ€™s KPI records can be aggregated over a specific time period to provide
 * an overall score for that stretch of time.
